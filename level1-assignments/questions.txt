Sum of Array Elements:
Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the elements in the array.

Factorial Calculation:
Implement a function that calculates the factorial of a given positive integer. Factorial of n is denoted as n! and is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.

Palindrome Check:
Create a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

FizzBuzz:
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

Max and Min Values:
Implement functions to find the maximum and minimum values in an array of numbers.

Reverse String:
Write a function to reverse a given string.

Prime Number Check:

Even and Odd Count:
Write a program that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the count of even and odd numbers in the array.

Leap Year Check:
Implement a function that checks if a given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.
